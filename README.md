# Password-Meter-and-Generator
Weak passwords are common source of e-mail and social website accounts hacks. 
To alleviate this problem, programs, often, when the user chooses a new password, 
determine if it is a legitimately strong password. This program tests the password against 
conditions that make a strong password.

Nowadays, there are many programs that provide programs to generate password for the user.
Similarly, this program will do that, but not make it extensively long like.
